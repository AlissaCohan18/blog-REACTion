Notes:
* didn't install package for .json, so will instead open a new terminal and will use: 
                    npx json-server  --watch data/db.json --port 8000
 * intentionally choosing a different server that what our other terminal/app is using

* upon pressing enter with "npx...8000" in the CLI will return: 
  Resources
  http://localhost:8000/blogs

  Home
  http://localhost:8000
 
 That resources .../blogs will be our endpoint for (fetching) a GET route to get the blogs
